capstone project

nyush attendance tracker

Have two terminal tabs for this. one for client and one for server

cd into client, then npm i 
cd into server, do the same: npm i

(if some dependencies havent been saved, then you might have to npm install xxxx)

in client:
npm start 

in server
npm start dev

localhost:8080

if server fails to start, it might be because mongodb is not running? setup?
if so -> open a new tab in terminal (cd-ed into server folder) and then type mongod
retry starting server
